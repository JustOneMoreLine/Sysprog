stat() command
 - reads files information
 - have other forms such:
	- lstat() : can read links
	- fstat() : can specifies which information to return

Daemon process
 - A process that runs in the background
 - Doesn't have a file descriptor
 - Can be created by fork-decouple-fork
 - The name comes from a greek demon that works to uphold physics law, literally working in the "background"

creat()
 - Another form from open()
 - Basically open with O_WRONLY, O_CREAT, and O_TRUNC flags enabled

Sparse File
 - A file which contains empty spaces or null called File Holes
 - Rather than consuming memory to store those empty spaces, it keeps a metadata which part of the file is empty
 - If a process reads a File Hole, it will instead reads the metadata
 - Use to save extra memories, creating a "virtual" memory
