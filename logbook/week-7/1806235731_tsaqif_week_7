Week 7 Notes:

change a file's owner:
 - chown [new owner] [filename]

special variables in bash:
 - $1, $2, $3, .. -> argument(s) passed from left to right
 - $@ -> an array of all passed argument(s)
 - $# -> number of args passed

#!/bin/bash -> a shebang, a must on every head of shell script, to tell what shell to use, in this case bash

command1 || command2 -> command2 would only be executed if command1 fails
command1 && command2 -> command2 would only be executed if command1 succed

zipping with tar:
 - tar [flags] [destination] [sources.....]
 - flags :
	- c : create
	- z : set to gzip
	- v : prints out process status, optional
	- f : filename
