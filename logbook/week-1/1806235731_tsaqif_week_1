	/srv : Contains site-specific files
	/sys : Contains device and drivers information
	/tmp : Contains temporary files
	/usr : Contains read-only user data
	/var : Contains dynamic variable files

(Absolute vs Relative) Path:
 - Absolute

 - Relative

(Application vs System) Programming
 - Application
	- Program to bridge between User and Hardware
	- User-oriented
